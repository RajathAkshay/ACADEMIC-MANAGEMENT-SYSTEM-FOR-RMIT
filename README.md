# ACADEMIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-FOR-RMIT
Academic Management System is a centralized consolidated platform that will record all the student/staff activities which help us view this information in an organised fashion and facilitate better portal for academic interaction. RMIT is currently focusing on improving the engagement of students and faculty with the help of a digital environment. Our major focus is on developing a cloud-based AMS system and structures the functionality according to RMIT’s mission and vision. The audit discloses that the existing AMS is impaired with functional complications in many student engagement activities such as student enrolment/billing and doesn’t meet the competent reporting requirements. The AMS predominantly hampers user experience for students and faculty and fails to align with the strategic direction of RMIT. We propose a comprehensive governance structure for the new cloud-based AMS which will be tested in parallel with the existing one and implemented accordingly. We are certainly on deploying an in-house development team who can work dedicatedly on shaping the product suitably. Detailed project planning, high-quality reporting and risk management strategies are predominant factors that are highlighted in the proposed project.
